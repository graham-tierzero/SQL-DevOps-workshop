## Abstract

This workshop is a deep dive on database DevOps centered on the SQL database projects format, where you will learn practical techniques for managing database changes whether your workload is operational, analytical, or somewhere in between. Our exploration begins with the foundational CI/CD capabilities for SQL projects, where you can ensure no matter how a database is developed it is in source control and can be verified before deployments to one or more environments. The same shared SQL projects format applies to the whole Microsoft SQL family, so we'll examine the advantages and special capabilities to understand when implementing DevOps practices for Fabric SQL, Azure SQL, or SQL Server. We conclude our workshop with some special topics at the core of good data DevOps practices, including security management, static data management, and coordinating changes with other workloads.
